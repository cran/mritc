        * R/mriio.R: the input and output of files of format "ANALYZE" and "NIfTI"
	are implemented through functions from the package "oro.nifti". They do not
	depend on the functions from the packages "AnalyzeFMRI" and "fmri" anymore.
	* R/writeNIfTI.R, readNIfTI.R: deleted.
	* DESCRIPTION/NAMESPACE/readMRI.Rd/writeMRI.Rd: changed accordingly.

	* DESCRIPTION: change to version 0.5-0  
	* src/: add the code for bias field correction.
	* man/mritc-package.Rd, mritc.Rd, makeMRIspatial.Rd: add the description 
	related to the bias filed correction.
	* R/mritc.R, mrispatial.R: add the code for bias filed correction.
	* R/getWeightsMRI.R: add this function to obtain weights used for bias 
	filed correction.

	* DESCRIPTION: change to version 0.4-0  
	* src/: update the code to parallel version using the OpenMP.
	* man/mritc-package.Rd: emphasize the parallel version using the OpenMP.

	  for pointing out that requirement.
	* DESCRIPTION: change to version 0.3-5  
	* man/mritc: add the note that the functions support 
	the various normal mixture models with at most eight components. Thank 
	Matthew Moores for pointing that out.

	* man/plot(print, summary).mritc.Rd: replace *.mritc with 
	\method{*}{mritc}. Thanks go to Achim Zeileis for pointing that out.

	* inst/CITATION: add citation to the JSS special volume paper
	* man/mritc.Rd: add citation to the JSS special volume paper and JASA
	paper
	* DESCRIPTION: change to version 0.3-4
	
2011-3-09 
	* R/measureMRI.R: Use the discrete instead of the fuzzy membership to 
	  obtain the true volumes and simplify the computation of rseVolume.
	* DESCRIPTION: change to version 0.3-3
	
2011-3-04  

	* R/measureMRI.R: Change the label of x-axis of the output density
	  plot.

	* DESCRIPTION: Change the version of misc3d to 0.7-1, which
	  has the crosshair bug fixed. Thanks go to Brandon Whitcher 
	  for testing the package (version 0.3-1) and pointing out the bug.

	* R/common.R (checkErrors): Fix a bug in comparison sum(prop)==1.
	* R/initOtsu.R: Change it to initNormMix.R. Besides initOtsu,
	  add a new method initProp.  Pull out the part to get mu, sd,
	  and prop based on threshold values.
	  (initThresh): New function to get mu, sd, and prop based on 
	  threshold values.
	* man/initOtsu.Rd: Change it to initNormMix.Rd to add initProp.
	* NAMESPACE: Add initProp.
