Description: Implements various methods for tissue classification in magnetic
        resonance (MR) images of the brain, including normal mixture models
        and hidden Markov normal mixture models, as outlined in Feng &
        Tierney (2011) <doi:10.18637/jss.v044.i07>. These methods allow a
        structural MR image to be classified into gray matter, white matter
        and cerebrospinal fluid tissue types.
